You probably want to download the zipped complete installer package, `https://github.com/aidancornelius/PowerPoint-Compressor/blob/master/Installer/PPTXKey.mpkg.zip` and install from there.\r\n\r\n# About\r\n\r\nLike so many other projects I put on GitHub, this one is something I've made, or derived from SA Government resources. Doing my public servant duty and making the source available.\r\n\r\nPowerPoint and Keynote Compressor for Mac OS\r\n\r\nThis installer will load an AppleScript that extracts your PowerPoint, uses a media encoder called Handbrake to compress movie files, then it will compress your presentation and all associated files with zip and leave you with a “compressed_yourpresentation.pptx”. \r\n\r\nKeynote support is temperamental, and the software has not yet been expanded to handle Keynote 6 presentations, those features will come in future versions.\r\n\r\nSource code for this application and it’s associated shell scripts are bundled inside the installed .app in your /Applications folder. The source is also available on Github where this installer was originally uploaded. Handbrake is compiled and downloaded from their website, obviously made available under the license of their choice.\r\n\r\nPlease contact aidancornelius@research.tfel.edu.au for support.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) the Government of South Australia, All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\r\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n\r\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\r\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\r\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n* Neither the name of the Government of South Australia nor the names of its\r\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\r\n  this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\r\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\nDISCLAIMED.
